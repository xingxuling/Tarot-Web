# Ad Integration Strategy Decision Document

## Current Status
- Existing AdMob integration is partially functional
- Unity Ads documentation is currently inaccessible
- Unity account verification issues encountered

## Decision
After careful consideration of the technical constraints and reliability requirements, we have decided to:

1. **Maintain AdMob as Primary Ad Provider**
   - Continue using existing AdMob integration
   - Leverage established AdMob test IDs for development
   - Use production AdMob IDs for release

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Banner Ads: Using AdMob banner components
   - Rewarded Ads: Using AdMob rewarded video ads
   - Virtual Currency: 10 coins per rewarded ad view

3. **Configuration**
   - Test Environment:
     ```
     ADMOB_PUBLISHER_ID=ca-app-pub-3940256099942544
     ADMOB_BANNER_ID=ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/6300978111
     ADMOB_REWARDED_ID=ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/5224354917
     ```
   - Production Environment:
     ```
     ADMOB_PUBLISHER_ID=[Production ID to be provided]
     ADMOB_BANNER_ID=[Production ID to be provided]
     ADMOB_REWARDED_ID=[Production ID to be provided]
     ```

## Rationale
1. **Reliability**: AdMob has proven React Native/Expo support
2. **Documentation**: Complete documentation and SDK support available
3. **Integration**: Existing working implementation reduces development risk
4. **Monetization**: Established ad network with reliable revenue tracking

## Future Considerations
- Monitor Unity Ads documentation and SDK support
- Consider Unity Ads integration when documentation and support improve
- Maintain modular ad context design for potential future provider changes

## Implementation Tasks
1. [x] Configure AdMob test environment
2. [x] Implement banner ad components
3. [x] Implement rewarded ad integration
4. [x] Set up virtual currency rewards
5. [ ] Configure production AdMob IDs
6. [ ] Implement ad loading error handling
7. [ ] Add analytics tracking

## Testing Requirements
1. Banner ads display correctly
2. Rewarded ads load and play
3. Virtual currency awarded correctly
4. Ad refresh intervals respected
5. Error states handled gracefully

This decision will be reviewed if Unity Ads documentation becomes available or if monetization requirements change significantly.
